This folder concerns itself with extraction of features from voices. I initially wanted to be able to capture things like raspiness and nasalness, but I don't know enough to break those down myself. There seem to be machine learning/statistical techniques that are good for this though, so that's where I'll start.

In particular, the library called [http://yaafe.sourceforge.net/features.html](yaafe) seems like a great place to start on this front.
