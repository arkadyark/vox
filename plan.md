I would like to create a visualization of data for voices, that breaks them down into informative components. There are a few steps involved here:

- Getting a bunch of songs
- Isolating (to some extent) the vocals on those songs/podcasts are easy
    - [this](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537101/deep-learning-machine-solves-the-cocktail-party-problem/)
    - [and this](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc209h/winter/assignments/a1/a1.html)
- Extracting features from the voices
    - Something like [yaffe](http://yaafe.sourceforge.net/features.html)
- Doing some dimensionality reduction/interpretation to get at what the features mean intuitively
    - Use extremely unique voices for this purpose (Q-Tip, Meechy Darko, Roman Mars, Paul Seufert)
- Presenting the data nicely
    - Polygon charts (like the ones used for multiple intelligence tests)
