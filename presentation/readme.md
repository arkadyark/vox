This folder concerns itself with how the data will be presented. I think [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart](radar charts) are a nice way to do this. For a start, doing it artist by artist just using some characteristic samples is good, but eventually as a stretch goal having it able to update live as you listen to a song would be amazing. I think something like that could really augment the listening experience.
