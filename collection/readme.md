This folder concerns itself with getting a sizeable set of audio data to work with. This should be a fairly diverse sample of voices, including:
- Music and podcasts
- Both male and female voices
- Voices from all over the pitch spectrum

More stretch goal type things:
- Different languages?
- Instruments? Sometimes I compare Coltrane's tenor or Bill Evans' piano to voices
