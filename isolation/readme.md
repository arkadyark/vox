This folder concerns itself with isolating from the samples a clean voice stream. The better this is done, the cleaner the feature extraction data will be. In general this is a difficult problem, from what I've heard. There are some simple techniques that seem to do an OK job, and the later parts of the pipeline can work with plain old podcast data until this part is ready.

Complex approach (but possibly not that hard to implement): [http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04658](Deep Karaoke)
